    title: "About Me"
    image: '/images/about_img.jpeg'
    content: |-
      The sheer power of data and how you can get unprecedented information out of it has initiated my journey into the world of data science.</br>
      Like others, my initial interest was web development which i continue to do for personal use .But as a student mathematics has always been my favourite subject, after realising it has a great use in data analytics I finally found my passionset in the right path. </br>
      Data science has been my main interest for a year now and my major zest lies in machine learning. I have learnt by doing projects and find python easy but do not limit myself to use it for data science alone.
      I am currently in my 6th semester of Computer Engineering, with a GPA of 9.7/10  </br>
      I am currently working on a project that will be used to help people find the best way to get around the city.
